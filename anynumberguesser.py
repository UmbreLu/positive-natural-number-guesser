I'll guess any positive natural number you think of. Just keep in mind
that the bigger the number is, more steps it will take to
find it out.

>ADVICE<: remember that in math NO number is "bigger than" ITSELF, so the
answer must be "no" if the program uses exactly your number to ask the
question.

>ADVICE2<: if you answer the "bigger or not" question wrongly, there is
no turning back, you'll have to restart the program. So, in order to
avoid errors, it's advised to write down your imagined number, specially
if it's big or have a scrabbled like pattern.

Let's begin.
