# positive-natural-number-guesser
With yes/no questions, this script guesses any positive integer number the user can imagine.
UPDATE: anynumberguesser is an improved version of numberguesser and should be taken as the main program.
anynumberguesser: now the user doesn't need to to suply the "big number" anymore. The program starts asking yes or no (bigger or not) questions straigh from the beginning, util it discovers the user's secret number.
