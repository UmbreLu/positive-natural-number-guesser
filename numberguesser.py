I'll guess any positive natural number you think of. But in order to
do so, you'll have to give me a big number to limit the possibilities, as
positive natural numbers are infinite.

There haven't to be any relationship between this reference number and the
secret number you'll think of, other than that the big number must be bigger
than the secret one. So your context number can be something really big like
"1000000" or more and your secret one something rather small like "127" or
anything in between 1 and the big number.

Just keep in mind that the bigger this number universe is, more steps I'll
take to guess your number.

Advice: remember that in math no number is "bigger than" itself, so the
answer must be "no"(n) if it's the case.

Let's begin.

Start thinking on your secret number. Try writing it down somewhere.

Now think on the bigger number that contains your secret number. Which number
is your big number?
